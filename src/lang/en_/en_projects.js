        'section1_text' : 'We support a variety of CO₂ compensation projects, coordinated by Atmosfair. 90% of their projects are certified with the CDM Gold Standard, which is the most stringent standard for climate protection projects. In addition, Atmosfair creates micro projects for countries that don’t meet those standards',

        'section2_title' : 'Projects that get rid of fossil fuels',
        'section2_text' : 'Renewable energy from sources like the sun, wind and water has no negative effect on climate and produces a minimum of greenhouse gas emission and no air pollution. This in contradiction to fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas. CO₂ok supports are in renewable energy: providing starting funds for solar energy and hydropower projects.',

        's2_title2': 'Solar energy',
        's2_title3': 'Hydropower',

        's2_text1' : 'Wind energy is the biggest renewable energy source in the Netherlands. It contributes up to 6% of the total electricity production. The Netherlands is known for innovative use of offshore wind turbines.',
        's2_text2' : 'Solar energy offers a clean, sustainable source of power. However, it is costly to implement and starting funds are often unavailable. That’s why CO₂ok helps funding solar energy projects that require financial support.',
        's2_text3' : 'Hydropower energy is power derived from energy of falling water or fast running water. The disadvantage of a hydroelectric powerstation is the high cost of startup. Because we value this renewable power source, we support hydropower projects.',

        'section3_title' : 'Emission reduction projects outside the Netherlands',
        'section3_text' : 'Atmosfair’s energy efficiency projects support sustainability development in developing countries by handing over technology, fighting poverty and reducing the emission of CO₂.',


        's3_title1': 'Cooking appliances',
        's3_title2': 'Solar cabins',
        's3_title3': 'Why our focus on developing countries?',

        's3_text1' : 'More efficient cooking appliances can save up to 80% of energy (and therefore CO₂ emission) in Africa and India. Thanks to their energy efficiency, these cooking appliances save time used for gathering fuel and reduce deforestation. Their decreased smoke and CO₂ production also contribute to better health.',
        's3_text2' : 'About 70% of the inhabitants of Lesotho, South Africa, live in the countryside, without connection to an electricity power grid. People use fossil-fuel-based candles and petroleum lamps for lighting, harming the climate and human health. Atmosfair and Solar Lights provide solar panels and Solar Home Systems.',
        's3_text3' : 'CO₂ is a worldwide problem, and it doesn’t really matter where on earth you fight. Atmosfair and CO₂ok are most effective in third world countries. The projects we fund can not only help reduce CO₂ emission but also improve the local quality of life, fuel the local economy and improve people’s health.',
