                        We support a variety of CO₂ compensation projects, coordinated by Atmosfair. 90% of their

                        climate protection projects. In addition, Atmosfair creates micro projects for countries that
                        don’t meet those standards.

Thanks to their energy efficiency, these cooking appliances save time used for gathering fuel and reduce deforestation. Their decreased smoke and CO₂ production also contribute to better health.
